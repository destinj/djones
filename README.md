A vector shares a lot of the same traits with an array, a vector is ubiquitous with a dynamic array. A vector is a simple data structure that can be used when dealing with adjacent storage. Vectors can be helpful if the values in a sequence often reduce or grow, or if a user needs to access an element by its specific position. This guide will describe how a vector works and how someone might use it in a program, as well there will be a simple example program of a vector in the repository under vectormain.cpp. The basis for this program came from www.thegeekstuff.com which is cited below, but I have made some changes to show how the modifiers pop_back and push_back work.
 Vectors work a lot like arrays, except that vectors can manipulate their storage without any manual sizing. Inside a vector is a dynamic array that allows storage to grow or reduce depending on how many elements are in the vector. To implement a vector it requires a header such as, #include <vector> then it must be initialized, for example a vector used for a sequence of integers could be initialized as,  vector<int> v;. Vectors have a different assortment of common member functions to name a few include, push_back which adds an element to the end of the vector, pop_back deletes the end element, begin returns the iterator to the beginning of the vector, end which returns the iterator to the end of the vector. Vector modifiers such as clear will clear out the entire vector and the modifier erase can delete an element at a certain position. Vectors are very efficient at deleting and adding elements from the end of the vector, but they are not as effective as other data structures when inserting and deleting elements from a certain postion other than the end.
  Finally, vectors are a simple yet efficient and effective way to put a sequence of variables into storage that can shrink or grow depending on how many variables are in the vector. Vectors are better than arrays in that they are not a fixed storage although unlike arrays vectors consume more memory to account for the potential growth of the vector. A good example for use of a vector would be a class could be constructed of a certain inventory a company is selling and then put that inventory into the vector.
